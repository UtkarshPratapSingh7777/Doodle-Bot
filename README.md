# Doodle-Bot
Developed a Doodle Bot for the Robomania event at Avishkar, MNNIT, in 2025. The robot uses an Arduino microcontroller to convert digital images into coordinate paths.
I implemented a Python script to process images and generate real-time drawing directions for the bot. This allowed for automated sketching with precise motor control.
